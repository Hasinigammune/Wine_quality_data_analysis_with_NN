# Wine_quality_data_analysis_with_NN

The Wine Quality (red) dataset in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets is used in this project. The dataset is related to red variant of the Portuguese ''Vinho Verde'' wine.  It consists of various physicochemical properties of red wine and their associated quality ratings.

The goal of this analysis is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests using a Neural Network model.
